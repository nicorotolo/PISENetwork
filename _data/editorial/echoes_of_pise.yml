    As a historian of philosophy I'm concerned with a philosophical understanding of the present world, especially in the light of past views of its enduring significance. I'm persuaded that antecedent views of our world are not antiquarian desuetudes, but an invaluable cultural legacy of insights that are constantly ready to be revived and rethought in their full meaning. Past thoughts and their tradition constantly influence the way in which we understand our surrounding reality in its present state and, in turn, how we may think and design its future. Today academic philosophy is coping with a crisis of impact, which means that the traditional "love of wisdom" no longer has a significant appeal to, and relevance for, present-day society. Postmodernists may argue that it never had, at least in the short term. For me the challenge remains a radical understanding of our time within its bigger picture, in consideration of its longue durée history of thought and its alternative open futures, rather than acquiring some prepackaged, ready-made ideas about how the things are supposed to go. As a matter of fact, when the PPE program was first imagined by the academics of early twentieth-century Oxford, it was presented as a modern take on a classical education. Most importantly, the course was intended as a way of enhancing the knowledge of the past in the service of contemporary urgencies and needs. The core subjects upon which the program was built were the "Literae Humaniores". The Latin name means literally "more human literature" and it included classics, philosophy and affiliated subjects. The label was given in contrast to the other complementary main field of study, namely "Literae divinae" or theology. "More human literature" means both that it is just human matter in comparison to higher divine revelations, but also that it's human matter at its finest. This human knowledge was soon supplemented by teaching in economics, politics and international studies. At Ca’ Foscari the original spirit of PPE lives again in our PISE program. Here is where a “more human” approach to reality finds a place to flourish and possibly offer a significant impact for generations to come.

    Pursuing a non-traditional academic path is not an easy choice. On the contrary, it is a brave and challenging decision whose ‘thrill’ will accompany you throughout most of the journey.
    I believe that everyone who comes across the PISE course webpage for the first time, often after a long period of reflection, asking themselves “What truly fits me?”, “Which subjects am I better at?”, “Which ones do I enjoy the most?”, after attending open days and speaking with professors or mentors, suddenly feels: “This exists? This looks like what I’ve been looking for!”
    Most Philosophy, International Studies and Economics (PISE) students I met back in 2019 shared a similar curiosity: they wanted to study both humanistic and quantitative subjects, were passionate about philosophy and its application to social and political issues, and had a great drive for a deeper understanding of the world-regions and the analysis of their economic and historical dynamics. 
    Many of them also sought the time to study and reflect, as well as the flexibility and ambition to explore a variety of subjects from different fields, in order to make a more informed decision about what to specialize in for their future studies.
    Ultimately, PISE is also what you make of it.
    My suggestion for new joiners would be to get well informed about the courses, start tailoring your study plan according to your most tailored interests, and give your best along your personal path. Opportunities for advanced studies and career development after PISE are truly diverse and are largely defined by what you build throughout your learning journey.
    At the beginning, each course presents its own challenges, from Logic and Philosophy of Science to Introduction to Probability for Economics or Development of Economic Thought, just to mention a few that new students often find demanding in their first year. However, don’t despair: each of them will help you expand the way you think and learn, broadening your analytical reasoning, sparking curiosity, and nurturing both creativity and intuition.
    During the second year, in my experience, you may discover whether your main interest truly lies in International Relations. While introductory modules in Politics and International Relations help you grasp the fundamentals of the field and the various sub-fields, courses such as History of Asia, focuses on the geopolitics and geoeconomics of the Caspian region offer a first specialized and in-depth exposure to the field. Moreover, the second year will include extensive philosophical studies as well, such as two modules in Political Philosophy and one in Moral Philosophy, which will be followed by Theoretical Philosophy in the third year.
    If you find yourself deeply engaged with the program, one of the most rewarding opportunities that PISE offers is the chance to win an Erasmus or Overseas scholarship. While the process can be competitive, it is certainly worth giving it a smart and determined try. Ca’ Foscari’s academic agreements are carefully designed and provide students with access to exceptional partner universities. Each institution you may attend for six or nine months will expose you to new learning methods, classroom dynamics, and interactions with professors and peers. Some courses might be more practice-oriented, while others may approach familiar subjects from entirely new perspectives.
    Your Erasmus or Overseas experience will likely play an important role in shaping your academic and career choices after PISE. Likewise, deciding to take on an internship, part-time job, or summer school can be valuable opportunities to broaden your experience, skills and potential.
    During your third year, you might discover a passion for International Law, another engaging course in the program. If the subject inspires you, you may wish to pursue further legal studies, such as EU Law, and continue in that direction for your masters. On the other hand, if throughout your path, you’ve found that your strengths and interests lie more in Economics, International Trade, Development or related areas, you will find a wide range of stimulating paths to explore under these domains as well.
    Fortunately, as the PISE Alumni community continues to grow, the academic and professional trajectories of its graduates are becoming increasingly visible. This allows current and future students to navigate their own paths more confidently, learning from the diverse experiences of those who came before them. Whether in consulting, EU institutions, international organizations, think tanks, academic research, or the private sector, PISE alumni are now working across Europe, including Italy, and beyond.
    Overall, I wish all current and future students an intellectually enriching, knowledge-expanding, and thought-provoking academic journey, one that goes beyond the ordinary academic routine and is always guided by confidence in yourself and in the future ahead.

    Up until the 2023 Summer, I had never engaged with the question of what to do after high school seriously, as I always felt university as something distant and not to be concerned of. But as the last year of high school was approaching, I begun wondering what to do next. Honestly, I had no clue. All I knew was that I wished to have an experience away from home and to attend a bachelor held in English with a multidisciplinary trait. Back in high school, my favourite subjects were Philosophy and History. Furthermore, I have always been fascinated by Politics and the Social Sciences. However, I never enjoyed the idea of ending up being a teacher either (to be fair, I can't imagine myself at 40 yo dealing with teenagers every day). Consequently, the PISE degree seemed like the natural choice. 


    Getting in wasn't easy at all. The first time I took the test I failed by 2 points and, in order to pass the second time, I had to practice a lot my English and reading skills . 
    Once I got in I had to face several classes very different in their nature, such as history, introduction to politics  as well as introduction to economics, logic, philosophy of science and introduction of probability.  I must say that surprisingly  the classes I have enjoyed the most have been the lasts I mentioned.  

    Honestly, it hasn't been all roses and flowers.  Adapting to Venice required me some time and for the first half of the year I remained very sceptical. The same multidisciplinary approach, which I was once seeking, made me question my choice. Nevertheless , after a while, I adapted to the city and realized that the course itself is structured in such a way that, if you are willing to put an effort, you can build a strong foundation in in Philosophy, Political Science and Economics and continue your studies afterwards in each of these subjects . I believe this is its best feature and the reason why I am now truly enthusiastic about it. 

    In my opinion, this bachelor teaches you to apply a lot of mental flexibility and attention. PISE introduces you to a big variety of subjects, offering a well-rounded education. While remaining  flexible and structured,  the course challenges you to shape your study plan according to your preferences and future goals.

    When I started studying PISE, I had no idea where it would take me. I have met three of my best friends through this course, which I consider the biggest gain. I believe this course is especially helpful for people like me who are unsure of what exactly suits them and want to explore different opportunities in life. I happened to end up in procurement sales, which I truly enjoy.
    
    I think PISE students learn a lot about human relationships and how negotiations work through various aspects. They learn how to be diplomatic, and these professional skills can really suit a PISE graduate with some specialization. Unfortunately, PISE itself does not delve deeply into any one area where you can be sure to start, but it teaches the essence of many professions. The diverse subjects I studied have also helped me gain a new perspective on life.
